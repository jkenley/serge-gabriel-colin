At FAES, he championed a culture where the institution's three core values — talent development, agility, and performance — were not slogans but operational realities. He brought the same discipline to every role: decisions must be evidence-based, resources must be optimized, and the most vulnerable must remain at the center of every policy. His inaugural address as Minister captured this philosophy: when prices rise and the currency depreciates, it is the most fragile families who bear the cost of instability. For Collin, fiscal discipline is not an abstraction — it is the frontline defense of the Haitian people."
